    "1. What are the advantages of a CNN over a fully connected DNN for image classification?\n",
    "    - CNN use far less parameters when the dataset are big (a node only connected to relative node in previous layer) -> faster to train, less overfitting, requires less training data\n",
    "    - A trained kernel of CNN can detect its learned feature anywhere in the image, not like DNN is fixed to thew spot -> generalize better\n",
    "    - DNN has no prior knowledge of how pixels are organized (eg: it doesn't know pixel\\[0\\]'s next to pixel\\[1\\] (CNN does know). -> lower layer of CNN can detect feature in small areas of images, higher layers can combine those to bigger features -> work well with most images."
